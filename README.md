Hi!
This is a Machine Learning thesis for the course INFO284 at the University of Bergen.
Our work is inspired by a lot of exisiting code, but has been altered a lot for the purpose of our task.
The thesis received an outstanding grade - A - which reflects great understanding of code, machine learning practice, and great performance.

Enjoy!
